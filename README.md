  <h2 style="color:green"> Modeling Complex Biological Networks: Protein-Protein Interactions for the HIV disease</h2>

This is a project for the Bioinformatics course of the MSc in Data Science @Sapienza. We worked on the analysis of the protein-protein interaction network for the HIV disease, performing data exploration and enrichment analysis, and then using clustering methods and network theory methods.

<h3> Description</h3>

The protein-protein interaction network of an organism is a model for the functions of genes and proteins. It allows to study the cellular behaviour and its reaction to physical, chemical and (more generally) environmental stimuli, as well as the exchange of signals. The aim of this work is to effectively map the PPIs associated to the HIV disease, in order to identify the seed genes, the proteins involved and, ultimately, the putative disease genes and modules, together with the related relevant properties. This will be done using a computational approach based on the application of graph-theory, clustering procedures and other algorithmic detection methods.

<h3>Content</h3>

We worked in Python, and the work is splitted into 5 Jupyter notebooks. The content of this repo is the following.
